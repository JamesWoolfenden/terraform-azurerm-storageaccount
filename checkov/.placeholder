Allowed storage account SKUs
This policy enables you to specify a set of storage account SKUs that your organization can deploy.	Deny 1.0.0

Deploy Advanced Threat Protection on Storage Accounts
This policy enables Advanced Threat Protection on Storage Accounts.	DeployIfNotExists, Disabled	1.0.0

Geo-redundant storage should be enabled for Storage Accounts
This policy audits any Storage Account with geo-redundant storage not enabled.	Audit, Disabled	1.0.0

Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled
Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking	Audit, Deny, Disabled 2.0.0

Storage account public access should be disallowed
Anonymous public read access to containers and blobs in Azure Storage is a convenient way to share data but might present security risks. To prevent data breaches caused by undesired anonymous access, Microsoft recommends preventing public access to a storage account unless your scenario requires it.	audit, deny, disabled 2.0.1-preview

Storage account should use a private link connection
Private links enforce secure communication, by providing private connectivity to the storage account	AuditIfNotExists, Disabled	1.0.0

Storage accounts should allow access from trusted Microsoft services
Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account.	Audit, Deny, Disabled 1.0.0

Storage accounts should be migrated to new Azure Resource Manager resources
Use new Azure Resource Manager for your storage accounts to provide security enhancements such as: stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, Azure Resource Manager based deployment and governance, access to managed identities, access to key vault for secrets, Azure AD-based authentication and support for tags and resource groups for easier security managementAudit, Deny, Disabled1.0.0

Storage accounts should have infrastructure encryption
Enable infrastructure encryption for higher level of assurance that the data is secure. When infrastructure encryption is enabled, data in a storage account is encrypted twice.	Audit, Deny, Disabled 1.0.0

Storage accounts should restrict network access	Network access to storage accounts should be restricted.
Configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premise clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges	Audit, Deny, Disabled 1.1.0

Storage accounts should restrict network access using virtual network rules
Protect your storage accounts from potential threats using virtual network rules as a preferred method instead of IP-based filtering. Disabling IP-based filtering prevents public IPs from accessing your storage accounts. Audit, Deny, Disabled 1.0.1

Storage accounts should use customer-managed key (CMK) for encryption
Secure your storage account with greater flexibility using customer-managed keys (CMKs). When you specify a CMK, that key is used to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. Using CMKs provides additional capabilities to control rotation of the key encryption key or cryptographically erase data.	Audit, Disabled	1.0.1
